      <h1>Microinsurance for Farmers</h1>
      <p>
        This platform provides affordable insurance coverage for farmers, helping them mitigate
        risks from crop failure, natural disasters, and market fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is to enable <strong>real-time insurance payouts</strong> based on 
        <strong> weather data</strong> and <strong>blockchain smart contracts</strong>.
        The current MVP allows <strong>admin access only</strong> for testing and configuration.
